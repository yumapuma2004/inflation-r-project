Linear regression model using time and inflation as independent variables

For the 2023 Quantify case study, we created a forecasting model to predict the losses, expenses and premiums for the next few years.
We used a linear model, considering time and inflation as our explanatory variables and the losses, expenses and premiums as the response variable. 
As a linear model is highly unlikely for a long term projection, we implemented a linear model to reflect short term projections.
